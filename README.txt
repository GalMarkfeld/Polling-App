This is a basic polling app written with the django framework.

In order to run the server type the command 'python outer/manage.py runserver' and the server will run at port 8000 at url http://127.0.0.1:8000.

To access your polls go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls, I added some initial ones to begin with.

You can vote on each poll and see all of the previous votes.

You have an admin page for managing the polls (adding, editing and removing). To access it go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and enter username = admin and password = 123456789.

In the admin page click on Questions and from there you will be able to manage everything.

Thank you for your time.
